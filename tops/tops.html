      <li> Alan Shearer CBE DL (born 13 August 1970) is an English football pundit 
       <p> and former professional player who played 
        as a striker.
         Widely regarded as one of the best strikers of all 
         time and one of the greatest players in Premier League history, 
         he is the Premier League's record goalscorer with 260 goals.[notes 1] He was named Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 1994 and won the PFA Player of the Year 
         award in 1995. In 1996, he came third in both Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. In 2004,
          he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[2] Shearer 
          was one of the first two players inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021.[3]</p></li></ol>

    <li> <p>Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and player,
       best known for managing Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.
        He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time and has won more trophies than any other
         manager in the history of football.[5] Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time with Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s with the "Class of '92", who contributed to making the club 
      one of the richest and most successful in the world.[6]</p></li>

    <li><h2>Liverpool</h2></li> 
   
    <ol> <li>
     <p>Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England.
       The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation.
      Domestically, the club has won 19 league titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA
       Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups,
       four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, 
       led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.
      Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".</p></li></ol>
